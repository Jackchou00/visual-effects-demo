Collect and reproduce interesting visual effects.

## Gelb Effect.
The ratio principle states that the perceived lightness of an object is explained by the ratio of light it reflects rather than the absolute amount of light it reflects, assuming even illumination across the visual scene. As long as illumination is constant across the field of view, the ratio captures the properties of reflectance. In an illusion such as the Gelb effect, the constant illumination requirement is violated.
